## Struct MetaData Library

A simple, macro-free library holds metadata for class fields in C++ 17. It's just a try for implementing go-style struct tags using the standard library.
It's an idea, not designed for high-performance use, and uses `std::any` inside. It's just simple to use now, and I plan to add more features.
Maybe I will work on performance issues someday, but I do not have any plans now.
